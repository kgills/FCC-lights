## Open Save Power Off

Open a previously saved show and use this as a starting point for the next show. Since most of our services are very similar in structure, it's easiest to make small changes to previous shows. 

Use the browser on the left screen to open and save shows. **File > Open > Show File Archive**. If you're having trouble finding the browser, press the **Displays** button on the ION Console. Look for the shows labeled with **FCC**. Since other organizations use the same equipment, there will be other shows saved here. 

 **File > Save** to save the show at the end of the service. You can **File > Save As** to save to a new location.

## Light Basics
Most of the lights can change colors and intensity. The house lights can only change intensity, they are always the same color. Use the **MS 2.1 "Full Plot"** tab to select the lights. You can select multiple lights or groups at the same time. The channel number will appear in the command line. 

Once you have the light(s) or group(s) selected, choose the desired color on the right. Use the **Level Wheel** to change the intensity.
